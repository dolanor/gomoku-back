# Gomoku-back

This is the backend of a multi-player Go game we implemented in school.
The frontend is visible [here](https://github.com/quentin-sommer/gomoku-front)

You'll need a correct Go setup and
`github.com/gorilla/websocket`

compile everything and run : `build_all_and_start.sh`

Or

* compile : `build.sh`
* compile frontend : `build_front.sh`
* run : `./gomoku-server`
